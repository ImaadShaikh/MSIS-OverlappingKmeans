Academic Research (Brief Overview)

As part of my master’s program, I worked on the implementation of an overlapping clustering approach.

Designed a modified K-Means algorithm supporting overlapping clusters.

Applied the model to financial datasets for segmentation and exploratory fraud analysis.

This work strengthened my analytical thinking and problem-solving skills, though my primary focus in this repository is on applied data analytics and business-oriented projects.
